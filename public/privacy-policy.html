  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: December 29, 2024</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>KC's Diary ("we", "our", or "the app") is a personal diary application. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>
  <p><strong>All your data stays on your device.</strong> KC's Diary stores all diary entries, photos, voice notes, and settings locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on external servers.</p>

  <h2>Information We Access</h2>
  <p>The app may request access to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To take photos for your diary entries (optional)</li>
    <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> To record voice notes (optional)</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> To add location tags to diary entries (optional)</li>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save and export your diary data</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To send daily reminders (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All this data remains on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third party.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The app uses the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Open-Meteo API:</strong> For weather information. Only your approximate location coordinates are sent to fetch weather data. No personal information is shared.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Fonts:</strong> For typography. Standard web requests are made to load fonts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>Your diary can be protected with a PIN lock and biometric authentication (fingerprint/face). The PIN is stored securely on your device.</p>

  <h2>Data Export and Backup</h2>
  <p>You can export your diary data as a backup file. This file is created locally and you control where it is saved or shared.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app is designed for personal use by individuals who can provide their own consent.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the app's support channels.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your data. You can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>View all your data within the app</li>
    <li>Export your data at any time</li>
